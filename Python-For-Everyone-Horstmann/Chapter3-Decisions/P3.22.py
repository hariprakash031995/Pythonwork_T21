#  Write a program that prompts for the day and month of the userâ€™s birthday and then
# prints a horoscope. Make up fortunes for programmers, like this:
#     Please enter your birthday.
#     month: 6
#     day: 16
#     Gemini are experts at figuring out the behavior of complicated programs.
#     You feel where bugs are coming from and then stay one step ahead. Tonight,
#     your style wins approval from a tough critic.
# Each fortune should contain the name of the astrological sign. (You will find the
# names and date ranges of the signs at a distressingly large number of sites on the
# Internet.)
