# Design a Customer class to handle a customer loyalty marketing campaign. After
# accumulating $100 in purchases, the customer receives a $10 discount on the next
# purchase. Provide methods

# Provide a test program and test a scenario in which a customer has earned a discount
# and then made over $90, but less than $100 in purchases. This should not result in a
# second discount. Then add another purchase that results in the second discount.
