# It is a well-known phenomenon that most people are easily able to read a text whose
# words have two characters flipped, provided the first and last letter of each word are
# not changed. For example,
#     I dnâ€™ot gvie a dman for a man taht can olny sepll a wrod one way. (Mrak Taiwn)
# Write a function  scramble(word) that constructs a scrambled version of a given word,
# ran domly flipping two characters other than the first and last one. Then write a
# program that reads words and prints the scrambled words.
